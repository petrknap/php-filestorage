## About resolved issue

> I need to use something where around 60,000 files with average size of 30kb are stored in a single directory (this is a requirement so can't simply break into sub-directories with smaller number of files).
>
> The files will be accessed randomly, but once created there will be no writes to the same filesystem. I'm currently using Ext3 but finding it very slow. Any suggestions?

This file storage solves this issue simply - it **creates virtual layer between file system and application**. Every path is converted into path which is composed from many directories which contains only small amount of sub-directories.

If you wish to store 1 000 000 files in single directory, this file storage converts paths and stores them in huge tree-structure. Every directory (exclude leafs) contains up to 256 sub-directories. Leafs contains only files.

### Advantages

 * Can store a huge amount of files in single directory
 * Can use fully localized paths to files (f.e.: `/シックス.log`)
 * Naturally protects files outside the storage
 * Every user can has separated and isolated file storage
 * Fully compatible and based on [League\Flysystem]

### Disadvantages

 * Real file structure is not user-friendly
 * Can not effectively get files sorted by any key (without DBMS)



## Usage of php-filestorage

### Standard usage

```php
<?php

use League\Flysystem\Adapter\Local as LocalAdapter;
use PetrKnap\Php\FileStorage\FileSystem;
use PetrKnap\Php\FileStorage\Plugin\SQLiteIndexPlugin;

$fileSystem = new FileSystem(new LocalAdapter(__DIR__ . "/temp"));
SQLiteIndexPlugin::register($fileSystem, __DIR__ . "/temp/index.sqlite"); // optional

$fileSystem->write("/file.txt", null);
$fileSystem->update("/file.txt", "Hello World!");

printf("%s", $fileSystem->read("/file.txt"));

foreach ($fileSystem->listContents() as $metadata) {
    $fileSystem->delete($metadata["path"]);
}
```
